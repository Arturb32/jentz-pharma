## Introduction

This prototype, inspired by pharmaceutical innovation, utilizes Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS to simulate digital health solutions.

## Features

Next.js: The core framework providing server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
React: A library for building user interfaces.
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
TypeScript: Adds static type definitions to JavaScript, enhancing development efficiency and reducing runtime errors.
Framer Motion: A library for React that makes creating animations easy.
React Icons: Provides access to popular icons.
OpenAI SDK: Enables integration with OpenAI's API for AI-powered features.
